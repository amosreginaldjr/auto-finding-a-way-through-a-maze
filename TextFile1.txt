Those intergers will be the random numbers that will be used for the:
user_start_location, obstacle_generation_locations, user_end_goal_location
>> You will need to use threads that way the user is not stuck waiting for the numbers
>>> Make it so that when a number is used, it is deleted from the file
>>> Limit the file to hold only 100 intergers that way it does not use 
	up too much of the user storage
	But when any digit is deleted, always replace it immeaditely
